        <h4>I have always loved Christmas and what it stands for. Tragically,
          since my dad passed away, I have not been able to find the joy of the
          Christmas spirit again. I have been challenged to read 1 chapter of
          Luke every day starting on December 1st until Christmas.  By the time
          I'm finished with Luke, it will be Christmas & I'll have read the
          entire Christmas account according to the great Dr. Luke. Please
          enjoy my very first blog created from scratch & coded by me. :-)</h4>

            Luke 1</a>, December 1, 2019</h2>
        <h6>Posted on Sunday, 12/1/19</h6>

        <p>There are so many things in any chapter, but there are two things
          that stood out to me at today's reading of Luke’s account in chapter
          1.  I have always been and am still in joyous awe at the fact that
          Yochanan (John) was filled with Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) even from
          his mother’s womb! Verse 15.  I mean, talk about maximizing your
          potential! To be filled with Holy Spirit even before you were born!
          Besides Jesus, you can’t get any more awesome than that! Oh! to have
          open eyes of who you are for your entire life, especially during your
          informative years would be astounding! Most of us simply struggle with
          adamic nature and then have plenty of time to nurture and develop that
          seed of sin inside of us. Then at some point in our life we have to
          “wrestle” with God trying to prove that we were right in our actions,
          until we finally realize and admit that maybe everything we’d been
          doing our entire life was actually wrong.  Once we accept this
          reality, then we are able to surrender to pure love.  I could go on
          forever, but this is to be a quick summary, so let me move onto the
          next event that is fascinating to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            In verse 18 we see John’s father Zacharias question the angel about
            the real chance of having a son since he & his wife were old.  The
            angel; in what seems to be an indignant response, tells Zacharias,
            I was sent from God to tell you the good news; in fact the answer
            to the prayers you have been asking God for years, and now you don’t
            believe me?! Because of your unbelief, you will be mute until the
            day of your son’s birth. Boom! Just like that Zacharias; who is a
            priest, can’t speak until the baby is born.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then in verse 34, we see that the angel comes to Miryam (Mary) and
            tells her that she is going to conceive the Son of Ha’Elyon
            (The Most High - God) and she asks how this can be since she is
            still a virgin.  The angel explains the supernatural process and
            Mary says, may it be done as you have said.  She is left by the
            angel having been called blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
            In both cases we have 2 people asking the messenger of God about the
            birth of their son.  In the case of Zachariah; his question is,
            “How can I be sure?” In other words; I don’t believe you, what
            evidence can you give me that this is going to happen. Zacharias'
            question is a statement of doubt, the angel even says, “because you
            didn’t believe my words.” This doubt brings a time of silence for
            Zacharias.  I’m sure this gave him a lot of time to think about why
            he doubted and most likely actually developed his faith stronger as
            he experienced the very real power of having the ability to speak
            stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Mary’s case, her question was not doubt, but an inquiry on how
            God would bring about this miracle.  She was interested in how
            something would take place without man’s intervention in the
            process.  She was fascinated by the reality that ANYTHING is
            possible with God. She showed a willingness to be a co-laborer with
            God by immediately answering the angel and saying "let it be so."
        </p>
        <p>
            Two things come to mind; 1), prayer works, and when you pray for
            something within God’s will; you should expect it to come to pass.
            2), instead of asking God to prove Himself to us by giving us proof
            that He will hold up His end of the bargain, we should shift our
            perceptions to ask God how we can prove ourselves to Him by being a
            part of what He is about to create. God always blesses those in His
            presence co-creating and bringing about His will on earth.
        </p>

            Luke 2</a>, December 2, 2019</h2>
        <h6>Posted on Monday, 12/2/19</h6>

        <p>The chapter starts out with what we like to call in my line of work,
          an unfunded government mandate.  A legal requirement is placed on all
          people to go back to their family's homeland and enroll for a census.
          No monies are given to make the trip, no provisions made for livestock
          left behind, nothing is supplied to help in this forced journey
          demanded by Caesar Augustus.  Ah, yes; there’s nothing that can tick
          me off faster than the abuse of power.  Welcome to tyrant dictatorship
          whether ran by fear and intimidation or by sleight-of-hand politics
          and deception, it is all a betrayal of relationship and community.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the goodness of God is found everywhere, even in the midst of
            this particular hardship.  In verse 8 we see that there are
            shepherds in the same country guarding their flocks.  Suddenly, an
            angel shows up in the middle of the night to a bunch of lowly
            hard-working shepherds who had a reputation for smelling bad due to
            the sweat of their labor, the smell of their livestock, and living
            in the dirt with the sheep kind of lifestyle.  They were often out
            on their own, and easily forgotten as they were an out-of-sight,
            out-of-mind kind of a vagabond with very little respect from society.
            But that was no deterrent for God’s angel and he brings the good
            news of great joy that will be for <strong>ALL</strong> people, even
            social outcasts as themselves!  The angel goes on to tell them where
            they can see the newborn Savior of the world for themselves.  Then
            in verse 13; hundreds, maybe even thousands of angels start having
            a worship service in the night sky right in front of the shepherds!
            What!?! I mean come on!  How many of you have ever got to be in a
            worship service with angels!???  The angels didn’t perform for important
            dignitaries like kings and queens, but put on a show for the poor,
            the humble, the forgotten, and the rejects of society.  Not only did
            they sing and praise in front of what the world would call the
            lowliest of humans but invited them into this grand cosmic
            celebration of the best event in all of earth’s history!!!
        </p>
        <p>
            On the one hand; Mary and Joseph are suffering an unreasonable
            hardship traveling miles on a donkey, fully swollen and pregnant.
            But on the other hand, this bummer trip put them in the right place
            (or country as the scripture says) for the shepherds to experience
            the most exhilarating moment in their natural lives.  Mary was
            already blessed, and in her moment of pain, her hardship literally
            became a blessing for those in their own hardship of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a world where the powerful create a society that defines who is
            in and who is out; in a man created culture where privilege and
            authority stays with the rich and the powerful at the cost of the
            poor, God reminds us that our riches and power mean nothing to the
            Creator of the universe and that He is a respecter of no man.  And
            just in case you missed it; God drives the point home by sending the
            Son of God to earth to be born in an animals feeding trough, in an
            even lower caste than the shepherds.  Jesus comes to level the
            playing field for everyone.  He comes to show the world the truth
            which is no matter who you are, what you’ve done, how great or how
            poor you are, you are just as important and valuable as anyone else.
            Male or female, athletic or pathetic, bright or a little light; all
            of heaven gave everything to love you and Jesus died for you
            specifically.  This is truly good news for all of us!

        <h6>Posted on Tuesday, 12/3/19</h6>

        <p>
          There is a lot of meat in this chapter & I had to do a little research
          to try to get a grasp of some concepts here.  Allow me to try to
          summarize and familiarize you with a few things that were new to me.
          If I were to ask you, what are the 3 top things people of this world
          want, what would you come up with?  Money, power, and sex perhaps? One
          would only have to watch 30 seconds of TV to see that obvious reality
          right?  So let’s take a look at this chapter because I think you may
          see some correlations.
        </p>
        <h4>Roman Hierarchy (in order of rank)</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Emperor: “King” of all of Rome, richest most powerful man in the
          world.</li>
          <li>Tetrarch: the governor of one of four divisions of a country or province in the Roman empire.
Legatus Augusti Proparetore, the military governor of a province of the empire, head of the judicial system. The highest rank an officer could achieve. Top dog of the military.
Legatus Legionis: Commander of a legion (5000 men divided into 10 cohorts). Usually came from the wealthy or privileged.
Tribunus Laticlavius: 2nd in command of a legion. Also reserved typically for aristocrats of Rome.
Praefectus Castrorum: Third in command of a legion.
Equestrian Praefecti: Commander of a horse auxillary in the legion. Horse or equestrian commanders were more prestigious than infantry commanders.
Tribune Agusticlavii: Staff officer, below Equestrian Praefecti but above Infantry Praefecti. 5 in each legion.
Infantry Praefecti: Commander of an infantry cohort.
Centurion: Commander of a century (about 80 men) in a legion. The highest rank an ordinary/common man could expect to achieve.
Ok, now that you have a flavor for that, let’s take a gander at a map to help organize our geographical awareness. https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/nwt/appendix-b/map-israel-jesus-time/
Cool, now let’s add a few names from scripture to paint the background for this chapter and to get a sense of who’s who in the zoo.
Tiberius was Emperor of Rome.
Herod: tetrarch of Galilee.
Philip (Pilipos):, Herod’s brother, tetrarch of Ituraea & Trachonitis
Lysanias: Tetrarch of Abilene
Pontius Pilate was the military governor of Judea. As head of the judicial system, he had the power to execute capital punishment (as in Jesus execution), as well as appoint the high priests. Some ancient test suggest that Pontius Pilate and Caephaes were friends. Now that sheds some new light on the trial of Jesus, or lack of.
Annas & Caiaphas: Jewish high priesthood.
Ok, so we got the backdrop from verses 1 - 3, now let’s jump into the rest of the story.
V3 John comes into ALL the region around the Jordan. Goes from before the Sea of Galilee to the Dead sea.  The Jordan runs right through the middle of all the Roman Empire. Repentance is preached to the ENTIRE Roman Empire.
V5 every valley will be filled – that which was empty will be made full (I can’t help but think of our souls and being empty of righteousness, will now be made full of God’s righteousness when we repent or our sin). Every mountain/hill will be brought low – giants obstacles will be crushed (Jesus will take all the hard challenges in our life and make them bow so that nothing will stand in the way of God’s children to reach our destiny in Christ). The crooked will become straight – (Jesus will make the path to God it’s shortest and easiest to for us to maneuver.) rough ways smooth (reiteration of Jesus making everything easy for us if we will repent or turn away from our own direction and follow Him.)
V6 As a result of what Jesus will do, all flesh will see God’s Salvation.
V 7-10 John confirms to the Roman empire that they are poisonous venomous snakes - the same deceitful creature in the garden of Eve that caused all of humanity to fall. He warns them that they can not deceive their way out of the coming wrath and that they must show true fruits of repentance.  Keep in mind he is speaking to the Roman empire who has conquered the known world, is used to having power and riches as a nation and accustomed to abusing that power anyway they wish.
V11 John addresses each social caste within the Roman empire and starts with the lowest or general population. He tells those who have extra, give to those who need. Sounds a lot like the 2nd commandment of love thy neighbor as you love yourself, doesn’t it?
V12 He addresses the wealthy and tells the tax collectors to only collect what they are supposed to. Isn’t there a commandment that says, thou shall not steal?
V14 He addresses those with power and tells them not to violently steal, or falsely accuse anyone, and to be happy with their salary. Hmm...thou shall not covet sounds like solid advice.
V19 & 20 we see that Herod, a powerful tetrarch with both money and power had yet a third thing which he thought was a privilege that he deserved and had actually succumbed to lust and had his brother’s wife.  He chose his lust (a thing which can never be satisfied and leads to wanting more and more outrageous cravings than the last) over God’s salvation and imprisoned John.  This is a tragic example of some men wanting darkness over light.  This is also an example of man thinking they have the power to stop truth or the authority to escape God’s wrath by imprisoning those who bring the gospel.
V23 The supernatural manifests in the flesh realm again. Not only was Jesus the living, earthly, human manifestation of God standing right in the middle of the world for all to see, but God again drives His point home by sending the Holy Spirit in the likeness of a form of a dove to sit upon Jesus.  And just to make it even clearer for anyone still wondering what’s going on, God SPEAKS from heaven and says, This is my Son in whom I am well pleased!!! Wowweeee! “What must we do?” the people ask. If you are asking what should you do to please God and God says I am pleased in my beloved son, may I offer that maybe you should do what Jesus does????
V23 We start off this chapter with the hierarchy of power and prestige of the Roman Empire, but then Dr. Luke finishes up with the lineage of Jesus.  There is a whole other study here to go through all the relationship of the lineage of Jesus, but that will have to be it’s very own research page.
Jesus - the son (as supposed - because He was actually not born of the seed of Joseph but from the Holy Spirit) of Joseph.  Another spiritual to flesh manifestation. This is hard for us to wrap our heads around but remember anything IS POSSIBLE with God, especially those things that are NOT POSSIBLE with man. Still God communicates in a way that we can understand and this is noted because it is how the Jewish understood family lineage - through the male. The rest of the chapter goes all the way through the human lineage and finishes with Adam - the son of God (the very first spirit to human flesh manifestation).  Aren’t you glad to be a son or daughter of God?
