            Luke 1</a>, December 1, 2019</h2>
        <h6>Posted on Sunday, 12/1/19</h6>

        <p>There are so many things in any chapter, but there are two things
          that stood out to me at today's reading of Luke’s account in chapter
          1.  I have always been and am still in joyous awe at the fact that
          Yochanan (John) was filled with Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) even from
          his mother’s womb! Verse 15.  I mean, talk about maximizing your
          potential! To be filled with Holy Spirit even before you were born!
          Besides Jesus, you can’t get any more awesome than that! Oh! to have
          open eyes of who you are for your entire life, especially during your
          informative years would be astounding! Most of us simply struggle with
          adamic nature and then have plenty of time to nurture and develop that
          seed of sin inside of us. Then at some point in our life we have to
          “wrestle” with God trying to prove that we were right in our actions,
          until we finally realize and admit that maybe everything we’d been
          doing our entire life was actually wrong.  Once we accept this
          reality, then we are able to surrender to pure love.  I could go on
          forever, but this is to be a quick summary, so let me move onto the
          next event that is fascinating to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            In verse 18 we see John’s father Zacharias question the angel about
            the real chance of having a son since he & his wife were old.  The
            angel; in what seems to be an indignant response, tells Zacharias,
            I was sent from God to tell you the good news; in fact the answer
            to the prayers you have been asking God for years, and now you don’t
            believe me?! Because of your unbelief, you will be mute until the
            day of your son’s birth. Boom! Just like that Zacharias; who is a
            priest, can’t speak until the baby is born.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then in verse 34, we see that the angel comes to Miryam (Mary) and
            tells her that she is going to conceive the Son of Ha’Elyon
            (The Most High - God) and she asks how this can be since she is
            still a virgin.  The angel explains the supernatural process and
            Mary says, may it be done as you have said.  She is left by the
            angel having been called blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
            In both cases we have 2 people asking the messenger of God about the
            birth of their son.  In the case of Zachariah; his question is,
            “How can I be sure?” In other words; I don’t believe you, what
            evidence can you give me that this is going to happen. Zacharias'
            question is a statement of doubt, the angel even says, “because you
            didn’t believe my words.” This doubt brings a time of silence for
            Zacharias.  I’m sure this gave him a lot of time to think about why
            he doubted and most likely actually developed his faith stronger as
            he experienced the very real power of having the ability to speak
            stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Mary’s case, her question was not doubt, but an inquiry on how
            God would bring about this miracle.  She was interested in how
            something would take place without man’s intervention in the
            process.  She was fascinated by the reality that ANYTHING is
            possible with God. She showed a willingness to be a co-laborer with
            God by immediately answering the angel and saying "let it be so."
        </p>
        <p>
            Two things come to mind; 1), prayer works, and when you pray for
            something within God’s will; you should expect it to come to pass.
            2), instead of asking God to prove Himself to us by giving us proof
            that He will hold up His end of the bargain, we should shift our
            perceptions to ask God how we can prove ourselves to Him by being a
            part of what He is about to create. God always blesses those in His
            presence co-creating and bringing about His will on earth.

            Luke 2</a>, December 2, 2019</h2>
        <h6>Posted on Monday, 12/2/19</h6>

        <p>The chapter starts out with what we like to call in my line of work,
          an unfunded government mandate.  A legal requirement is placed on all
          people to go back to their family's homeland and enroll for a census.
          No monies are given to make the trip, no provisions made for livestock
          left behind, nothing is supplied to help in this forced journey
          demanded by Caesar Augustus.  Ah, yes; there’s nothing that can tick
          me off faster than the abuse of power.  Welcome to tyrant dictatorship
          whether ran by fear and intimidation or by sleight-of-hand politics
          and deception, it is all a betrayal of relationship and community.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the goodness of God is found everywhere, even in the midst of
            this particular hardship.  In verse 8 we see that there are
            shepherds in the same country guarding their flocks.  Suddenly, an
            angel shows up in the middle of the night to a bunch of lowly
            hard-working shepherds who had a reputation for smelling bad due to
            the sweat of their labor, the smell of their livestock, and living
            in the dirt with the sheep kind of lifestyle.  They were often out
            on their own, and easily forgotten as they were an out-of-sight,
            out-of-mind kind of a vagabond with very little respect from society.
            But that was no deterrent for God’s angel and he brings the good
            news of great joy that will be for <strong>ALL</strong> people, even
            social outcasts as themselves!  The angel goes on to tell them where
            they can see the newborn Savior of the world for themselves.  Then
            in verse 13; hundreds, maybe even thousands of angels start having
            a worship service in the night sky right in front of the shepherds!
            What!?! I mean come on!  How many of you have ever got to be in a
            worship service with angels!???  The angels didn’t perform for important
            dignitaries like kings and queens, but put on a show for the poor,
            the humble, the forgotten, and the rejects of society.  Not only did
            they sing and praise in front of what the world would call the
            lowliest of humans but invited them into this grand cosmic
            celebration of the best event in all of earth’s history!!!
        </p>
        <p>
            On the one hand; Mary and Joseph are suffering an unreasonable
            hardship traveling miles on a donkey, fully swollen and pregnant.
            But on the other hand, this bummer trip put them in the right place
            (or country as the scripture says) for the shepherds to experience
            the most exhilarating moment in their natural lives.  Mary was
            already blessed, and in her moment of pain, her hardship literally
            became a blessing for those in their own hardship of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a world where the powerful create a society that defines who is
            in and who is out; in a man created culture where privilege and
            authority stays with the rich and the powerful at the cost of the
            poor, God reminds us that our riches and power mean nothing to the
            Creator of the universe and that He is a respecter of no man.  And
            just in case you missed it; God drives the point home by sending the
            Son of God to earth to be born in an animals feeding trough, in an
            even lower caste than the shepherds.  Jesus comes to level the
            playing field for everyone.  He comes to show the world the truth
            which is no matter who you are, what you’ve done, how great or how
            poor you are, you are just as important and valuable as anyone else.
            Male or female, athletic or pathetic, bright or a little light; all
            of heaven gave everything to love you and Jesus died for you
            specifically.  This is truly good news for all of us!

        <h6>Posted on Tuesday, 12/3/19</h6>

        <p>
          There is a lot of meat in this chapter & I had to do a little research
          to try to get a grasp of some concepts here.  Allow me to try to
          summarize and familiarize you with a few things that were new to me.
          If I were to ask you, what are the 3 top things people of this world
          want, what would you come up with?  Money, power, and sex perhaps? One
          would only have to watch 30 seconds of TV to see that obvious reality
          right?  So let’s take a look at this chapter because I think you may
          see some correlations.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>ROMAN HIERARCHY</strong> <em>(in order of rank)</em></h4>
        <ol>
          <li ><strong id="blue">EMPEROR:</strong> “King” of all of Rome, richest most powerful man in the
          world.</li>
          <li><strong id="blue">TETRARCH:</strong> the governor of one of four divisions of a country or
            province in the Roman empire.</li>
          <li><strong id="blue">LEGATUS AUGUSTI PROPARETORE:</strong> the military governor of a province
              of the empire, head of the judicial system. The highest rank an
              officer could achieve. Top dog of the military.</li>
          <li><strong id="blue">LEGATUS LEGIONIS:</strong> Commander of a legion (5000 men divided into 10
            cohorts). Usually came from the wealthy or privileged.</li>
          <li><strong id="blue">TRIBUNUS LATICLAVIUS:</strong> 2nd in command of a legion. Also reserved
            typically for aristocrats of Rome.</li>
          <li><strong id="blue">PRAEFECTUS CASTRORUM:</strong> Third in command of a legion.</li>
          <li><strong id="blue">EQUESTRIAN PRAEFECTI:</strong> Commander of a horse auxillary in the legion.
            Horse or equestrian commanders were more prestigious than infantry
            commanders.</li>
          <li><strong id="blue">TRIBUNE AGUSTICLAVII:</strong> Staff officer, below Equestrian Praefecti
            but above Infantry Praefecti. 5 in each legion.</li>
          <li><strong id="blue">INFANTRY PRAEFECTI:</strong> Commander of an infantry cohort.</li>
          <li><strong id="blue">CENTURION:</strong> Commander of a century (about 80 men) in a legion.
            The highest rank an ordinary/common man could expect to achieve.</li>
        </ol>

          <p>Ok, now that you have a flavor for that, let’s take a gander at a
            map to help organize our geographical awareness. </p>

            <img src="C:\Users\ctclemons\Documents\GitHub\JagTheBlue.github.io\RulersMap.jpg" alt="Roman Ruler's Map" width="90%">
            <a href="https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/nwt/appendix-b/map-israel-jesus-time/"></a>

          <p>Cool, now let’s add a few names from scripture to paint the
            background for this chapter and to get a sense of who’s who in the
            zoo.</p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Tiberius:</strong> Emperor of Rome.</li>
              <li><strong>Herod:</strong> Tetrarch of Galilee.</li>
              <li><strong>Philip (Pilipos):</strong> Herod’s brother, Tetrarch of Ituraea & Trachonitis</li>
              <li><strong>Lysanias:</strong> Tetrarch of Abilene</li>
              <li><strong>Pontius Pilate:</strong> Military governor of Judea. As head of
                the judicial system, he had the power to execute capital
                punishment (as in Jesus execution), as well as appoint the high
                priests. Some ancient test suggest that Pontius Pilate and
                Caephaes were friends. Now that sheds some new light on the
                trial of Jesus, or lack of.</li>
              <li><strong>Annas & Caiaphas:</strong> Jewish high priesthood.</li>

        <p>Ok, so we got the backdrop from verses 1 - 3, now let’s jump into
            the rest of the story.</p>
        <p>V3 John comes into ALL the region around the Jordan. Goes from
            before the Sea of Galilee to the Dead sea.  The Jordan runs right
            through the middle of all the Roman Empire. Repentance is preached
            to the ENTIRE Roman Empire.</p>
        <p>V5 every valley will be filled – that which was empty will be made
            full (I can’t help but think of our souls and being empty of
            righteousness, will now be made full of God’s righteousness when
            we repent or our sin). Every mountain/hill will be brought low – giants
            obstacles will be crushed (Jesus will take all the hard challenges
            in our life and make them bow so that nothing will stand in the way
            of God’s children to reach our destiny in Christ). The crooked will
            become straight – (Jesus will make the path to God it’s shortest
            and easiest to for us to maneuver.) rough ways smooth (reiteration
            of Jesus making everything easy for us if we will repent or turn
            away from our own direction and follow Him.)</p>
        <p>V6 As a result of what Jesus will do, all flesh will see God’s
            Salvation.</p>
        <p>V 7-10 John confirms to the Roman empire that they are poisonous
            venomous snakes - the same deceitful creature in the garden of Eve
            that caused all of humanity to fall. He warns them that they can
            not deceive their way out of the coming wrath and that they must
            show true fruits of repentance.  Keep in mind he is speaking to
            the Roman empire who has conquered the known world, is used to
            having power and riches as a nation and accustomed to abusing that
            power anyway they wish.</p>
        <p>V11 John addresses each social caste within the Roman empire and
            starts with the lowest or general population. He tells those who
            have extra, give to those who need. Sounds a lot like the 2nd
            commandment of love thy neighbor as you love yourself, doesn’t it?</p>
        <p>V12 He addresses the wealthy and tells the tax collectors to only
            collect what they are supposed to. Isn’t there a commandment that
            says, thou shall not steal?</p>
        <p>V14 He addresses those with power and tells them not to violently
            steal, or falsely accuse anyone, and to be happy with their salary.
            Hmm...thou shall not covet sounds like solid advice.</p>
        <p>V19 & 20 we see that Herod, a powerful tetrarch with both money
            and power had yet a third thing which he thought was a privilege
            that he deserved and had actually succumbed to lust and had his
            brother’s wife.  He chose his lust (a thing which can never be
            satisfied and leads to wanting more and more outrageous cravings
            than the last) over God’s salvation and imprisoned John.  This is
            a tragic example of some men wanting darkness over light.  This is
            also an example of man thinking they have the power to stop truth
            or the authority to escape God’s wrath by imprisoning those who
            bring the gospel.</p>
        <p>V23 The supernatural manifests in the flesh realm again. Not only
            was Jesus the living, earthly, human manifestation of God standing
            right in the middle of the world for all to see, but God again
            drives His point home by sending the Holy Spirit in the likeness
            of a form of a dove to sit upon Jesus.  And just to make it even
            clearer for anyone still wondering what’s going on, God SPEAKS from
            heaven and says, This is my Son in whom I am well pleased!!!
            Wowweeee! “What must we do?” the people ask. If you are asking
            what should you do to please God and God says I am pleased in my
            beloved son, may I offer that maybe you should do what Jesus does????</p>
        <p>V23 We start off this chapter with the hierarchy of power and
            prestige of the Roman Empire, but then Dr. Luke finishes up with
            the lineage of Jesus.  There is a whole other study here to go
            through all the relationship of the lineage of Jesus, but that
            will have to be it’s very own research page.</p>
        <p>Jesus - the son (as supposed - because He was actually not born of
            the seed of Joseph but from the Holy Spirit) of Joseph.  Another
            spiritual to flesh manifestation. This is hard for us to wrap our
            heads around but remember anything IS POSSIBLE with God, especially
            those things that are NOT POSSIBLE with man. Still God communicates
            in a way that we can understand and this is noted because it is how
            the Jewish understood family lineage - through the male. The rest of
            the chapter goes all the way through the human lineage and finishes
            with Adam - the son of God (the very first spirit to human flesh
            manifestation).  Aren’t you glad to be a son or daughter of God?

        <p>
          3”And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this
          stone that it be made bread. 4And Jesus answered him, saying, It is
          written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of
          God.”  This passage is interesting because of the word “WORD.”  In
          the book Pneumatology, The Ecumenical, International, and Contextual
          Perspective by Velli-Matti Karkkainen, it discusses a theologian named
          Maximus the Confessor, possibly a Syrian Monk in the 5th or 6th century
          in the Eastern Christian Church who makes the following statement: “The
          Holy Spirit is not absent from any created being, especially not from
          one which in any way participates in intelligence...The Holy Spirit is
          present unconditionally in all things, in that He embraces all things,
          provides for all, and vivifies the natural seeds within them...He embraces
          in unity the spiritual knowledge of all created things, providentially
          permeating all things with His power, and vivifying their inner essence
          in accordance with their nature.”  Simply put, the Spirit of God has made
          everything that exists as a living being. It occurred to me that my own
          Native American culture and religion believed that all things are alive,
          since everything can consume on level. Rocks can actually absorb water
          for example.  Then I think of John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word,
          and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And then again in John
          1:14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen
          his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father,
          full of grace and truth. I also think of the scripture that says that
          everything that has breath will return back to God. Ecclesiates 12:7 then
          the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return
          to God who gave it. The book went on to say, that some schools of thought
          offer that the Holy Spirit can possess words. If the Spirit of God can
          make donkeys speak and the rocks cry out praise, then what is so hard
          to believe that the Holy Spirit can possess words too?  If the Word became
          flesh and dwelt among us on the earth as Jesus, why can’t every word have
          Holy Spirit power and authority?  It suddenly occurred to me that our
          prayers can have the Holy Spirit possess them.  It suddenly made sense
          to me why as a child of God, I have the heritage to speak blessings or
          cursing, life or death and that when I command an illness or demon to
          leave by the authority of the name (Word) of Jesus that it has to obey!
          I’ve seen many a miracle in my lifetime already.  The Lord has blessed
          by using me as a vessel to bring a gift of healing to someone.  Even
          with all that, I couldn’t really understand why and kept looking for
          a pattern to repeat or some action that I needed to do in order to
          have miracles, signs, and wonders following me.  I knew that it was never
          I that did anything, but the Holy Spirit.  Yet, my logical mind was always
          in overdrive trying to analyze everything.  When Jesus said that man doesn’t
          live by bread alone, but by every Word of God, He really meant that it is
          God that gives life to man, and not the eating or nurturing of the physical
          body as we assume.  Everything that ever came into existence is because
          God spoke it into being and we live each day by God’s daily bread and
          Word that He speaks every moment to sustain our life.  Can the concept
          of devotion and daily communion and relationship with God suddenly seem
          more urgent to you?  It should, because without it, life in your mortal
          body will not continue and the longer it is without the constant nourishment
          of the Word of God, it deteriorates more and more every day. “For the
          wages of sin (opposite direction or missing the mark of God’s will) is death.
          Romans 6:23.  Jesus says, “...I (the WORD) came that they may have life
          and have it abundantly.” John 10:10.</p>
        <p>In verse 18 we see what Jesus is tasked to do with WORDS. To declare
          hope to the discouraged, to release those chained in bondage, to heal
          the blind, to encourage the broken-hearted, to proclaim the acceptable
          year of the Lord, the return of the King. </p>
        <p> Starting in verse 31 we read accounts of Jesus casting out demons.
          In verse 38 we read accounts of Jesus healing one of the disciples
          mother-in-laws (healing for the house of Israel or what we would call
          today our church). Then in verse 40 we see Jesus heals everything and
          everyone including those not within the house of Israel (the gentiles
          or what we would today call those outside our congregations).</p>
        <p>What great news for everyone!  There is healing for all of us!  And
          this good, gracious, life-giving, redemptive, message is known as the
          gospel.  And this is how Jesus finishes the fourth chapter of Luke,
          he reminds everyone that He must preach the GOOD NEWS. Jesus must announce
          His Holy Spirit WORD to the entire world!!!</p>

            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+5&version=NASB">Luke 5</a>, December 5, 2019</h2>
          <h6>Posted on Wednessday, 12/5/19</h6>

        <p>In the first 11 verses, Jesus is swarmed by people wanting to hear
          the WORD of God, but Jesus notices 2 boats with fishermen nearby working.
          Jesus goes to Shim’on (Simon’s) boat and asks to be taken out a little
          ways from the shore and then starts teaching the crowd from there.  So
          cool that Jesus has this entire flock following Him around groping for
          His attention, but Jesus notices a few men who are not looking for His
          attention, who are busy trying to make ends meet by working all night.
          Rather than turning an indignant shoulder to them, He immediately engages
          them into His mission.  Then after he feeds the crowds & by default the
          fishermen; God’s WORD, Jesus then helps the fishermen finish what they
          were working so hard to accomplish. I love the fact that Jesus isn’t a
          user.  He doesn’t commandeer the fishermen’s boats, take-up their already
          over-booked time, then leave them further behind in their duties, but
          blesses them with a miracle of catching more fish in a moment than they
          were able to do on their own, even after working all night long.  </p>
        <p>In verse 5, Peter recognizes and respects Jesus as a Rabbi, but doesn’t
          believe the Rabbi’s WORD initially and protests telling Jesus that they
          have already tried everything all night long and still have not been
          able to bring in a catch.  But out of cultural respect for Rabbis, he
          does what Jesus directs him to do. Jesus, who is a carpenter by trade,
          not a fisherman proves to Peter, James, and John that their wisdom and
          experience in fishing their whole lives is not as able as the power &
          authority of the WORD of God.</p>
        <p>  In verse 10; the fishing crew is astonished at the massive catch of
          fish they recieve by obeying Jesus and suddenly understand their sinful
          unbelief.   All three fall to their knees and declare their shame by
          telling Jesus to leave from their unholy presence as they are sinners.
          What a wonderful moment of fear and reverence must have come over the
          fisherman for them to bow at Jesus feet.  No doubt they were probably
          questioning their earthly wisdom and competence when they couldn’t bring
          in a haul for the day, but what they perceive as lack of earthly wisdom,
          God replaces in the moment with heaven’s wisdom.  For “The fear of the
          LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.”
          Proverbs 9:10.  Notice Jesus doesn’t hurl an insulting, “I told you so!”
          at them but rather calms their fears and tells them not to be afraid.
          But it gets even better than that! After Jesus calms their fears, he
          then employs them in spreading the Good News and informs them that
          they will now be a fisher of men! </p>
        <p>What popped out at me today was Verse 16, where Jesus made a habit
          of pulling away from the crowds so that He could pray. He found the
          fishermen working overtime trying to make ends meet and not taking the
          time for spiritual disciplines like praying.  Jesus has many many people
          who want His healing touch. Jesus has more work than any man could
          possibly accomplish on his own, yet Jesus makes taking time to do
          quality prayer time a priority.  He doesn’t let the overwhelming amount
          of tasks or the pressing cry of the crowds steal His time with the
          Father away.  I think this is a very important lesson that the LORD
          is showing us here.  Ministering to people can be heart-breaking.
          Because many Christians love people and have such big hearts, it can
          be difficult to say no to those begging for our attention, but Jesus
          the Minister or all ministers, reminds us that we can not live without
          the WORD of God.  We must make time away with God the priority over
          everything else, even ministry.

            Luke 6</a>, December 6, 2019</h2>
          <h6>Posted on Thursday, 12/6/19</h6>

        <p>
          Verse 23 takes the cake for today’s reading.  Luke 6:23 “Rejoice and
          leap for joy on that day! Behold, your reward will be great in heaven.
          For their ancestors treated the prophets in the same way.” This passage
          is literally in the middle of the chapter.  With 49 verses; it is the
          end of the first half of the chapter as 24 is the beginning of the second
          half to be exact.  The verses immediately before it and immediately
          following it make a nice little chiasm.  Example of what I’m talking
          about:
        </p>

        <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>ORIGIN VERSE</th>
                <th>FUTURE VERSE</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>20 Blessed are you who are poor, for the kingdom of God is
                  yours.</td>
                <td> 24 But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your
                  consolation.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>21 Blessed are you who are now hungry, for you will be satisfied.
                </td>
                <td> 25 But woe to you who are filled now, for you will be hungry.
            </td>
            <tr>
                <td>22 Blessed are you when people hate you, (and speak ill of you)...
                </td>
                <td> 26 Woe to you when all speak well of you,
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Then the end of 26 ties it back into the reason to rejoice and dance when
      you’re persecuted by turning the tables and showing what will happen to those
      who tell lies. Verse 26b…”for their ancestors treated the false prophets in
      this way.”
    </p>
    <p>There’s a lot of discussion about Christian ethics in this chapter. A lot
    of stories about grace vs. the law. And right in the middle of all of it,
    Jesus exhorts us to stay strong, to stay true, and in fact to know that even
    in the face of poverty, hunger, and defamation; know that in the end; we win!
    And that winning will be worth all the suffering we may experience now.  So
    certain of victory is Jesus that He backs it up with proof. He shows us history
    repeats itself by reminding us that the prophets of God were treated poorly
    by the same ancestors of those hurting us now. In other words, satan’s offspring
    aren’t doing anything new to God’s children.  But, rest assured; as proof through
    repeated history again and again, we see that those who are living in opulence
    now through corruption, will be brought into poverty and hunger later.  And
    those who slander us now will receive their own punishments and even death
    as a false prophet later just like it was of old.

        Luke 7</a>, December 7, 2019</h2>
      <h6>Posted on Thursday, 12/7/19</h6>

    <p>47 Because of this, I tell you that her sins — which are many! — have been
      forgiven, because she loved much. But someone who has been forgiven only a
      little loves only a little.” 48 Then he said to her, “Your sins have been
      forgiven.” </p>
    <p>Some of us are very passionate. We think deeply and feel intensely.  We
      are called emotional and often thought of inferior somehow because we are
      so easily overwhelmed by our emotions and therefore it is assumed that we
      cannot make sound logical decisions.  That assumption is just simply inaccurate.
      This is often why children and women are considered the weaker.  While it
      may take more time to process emotions, emotional/passionate people absolutely
      can make sound logical decisions.  In fact our ability to consider the cost
      of our decision is enhanced because we are able to take into account not
      only the material risk and value of the things involved in the decision but
      we are able to ascertain and recognize the value of the human condition and
      factor it into the cost.  For example, in business, all decisions are based
      upon profit and the ability to make money.  It is the most powerful motivation
      in the industry. But if you were to ask any terminally ill patient what they
      want more than anything, you will find that money is not even in the top 5
      requests.  What they have come to understand is that time is the most important
      thing and it is not so that they can make more money but so they could have
      loved more. They would give up all the money in the world if they could have
      more time to spend holding their grandchildren, more time to restore their
      relationships with their estranged children, more time to see the wonders
      and glories of God’s creation, more time to appreciate their spouses, more
      time to experience the gift of love, peace, joy, and explore the wonders of
      the emotions God created us with.</p>
    <p>Those who would lord over us with intellectual prowess often are involved
      in authoritarian positions.  They tend to keep us oppressed by creating rules
      to develop a society that says emotions are forbidden in the workplace or
      other communal properties and are to be considered highly unprofessional.
      While I agree that we must exercise control over emotions that would lead
      to harming ourselves or others, we should respect the rights and presence
      of others, and the sensual emotions of lust must be restrained; those who
      think they are superior because of their ability to turn off their emotions
      would have the passionate believe that they are more akin to animals than
      humans.  This is just another form of oppression through identity abuse.
    </p>
    <p>In verses 39-43, Jesus perceives the Pharisees critical thought about
      allowing a sinner woman to wash His feet.  Jesus tells him a story about
      money, something he can understand.  He asks if 2 people owed someone money,
      one of them owing 10 times more than the other and both their debts were
      dropped, who would love the forgiver more? Of course the one owing the most
      money would love or be more grateful. Then Jesus compares the woman to the
      same story.  He says, this woman who you look at with disgust and whose sins
      are many are forgiven because she loves much.  Then Jesus tells the woman
      your trust (in Me), your faith has saved you, go in peace.  In other words,
      she was forgiven.  Scripture doesn’t record that she asked for forgiveness,
      but Jesus knows the intent of the heart.  The woman found out that Jesus
      was eating at Simons the Pharisees house.  She must have known who Jesus was.
      She weeps at His feet and washes them with her tears and her hair.  She comes
      undone in front of the Son of God.  This is a sign of humbleness, my guess
      is that it was an acknowledgement of the contrast of her sinful nature to
      the holiness of God’s nature, just like when Peter and the fisherman bowed
      before Jesus when they realized they were sinners in the presence of the
      Holy God.</p>
    <p>Then Jesus drops the bomb by explaining to the Pharisee, that she has been
      forgiven much which has caused her to love much, passionately.  The woman
      allowed her intense emotions to communicate her remorse for her sin and
      plead the forgiveness of Jesus.  When Jesus blesses her, gives her
      forgiveness, she leaves.  Yet the Pharisee who has followed all the rules,
      reasons that he safe because he can use his intelligence to quote the law
      and is smart enough to use it masterfully as his defense.  But those who
      have not been forgiven much do not love much, they don’t feel the need to
      be grateful. </p>
    <p>While knowledge and intelligence are definitely gifts of God also, and I
      am glad for those who excel at it, it is not a gift more superior than
      others.  Just like being passionate does not make someone inferior in any
      way either.  Jesus uses all gifts of both intelligence and emotion or
      passion.  In the time of temptation in the wilderness He used His
      intelligence to quote law and scripture that the devil tried to twist. But
      He endured the cross for the JOY (passion/emotion) set before Him. In the
      end, LOVE is always the final battle.
